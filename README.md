# Linear Regression Code

This repository contains code for performing linear regression using the scikit-learn library. The code is designed to predict air quality index (AQI) based on various atmospheric parameters.

## Dataset

The code utilizes the "city_day.csv" dataset, which contains daily air quality data for multiple cities. The dataset is loaded using pandas and preprocessed before performing linear regression.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn


## Results

The code fits a linear regression model to the data and predicts the AQI values for the test set. It calculates the mean squared error (MSE) and R2 score as evaluation metrics for the model.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the code, feel free to submit a pull request.
